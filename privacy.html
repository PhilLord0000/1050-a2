                    <h3>Sale of Your Data to Third Parties</h3>
                    Look man making all this stuff was hard work, we've got mouths to feed and to be honest there's not that many people out there with $10,000,000 to drop a console the size of the Great Pyramid of Giza, so to make this company solvent we're selling you off to the highest bidder. The human being has been reduced to a database of interests and habits and people pay good money for that shit.</article>
